# Breast Cancer Detection with the Python SDK

This is a reproduction of the [example](https://github.com/pachyderm/examples/tree/master/breast-cancer-detection) found in Pachyderm's examples repository. Rather than using `pachctl`, the repos and pipelines are created using their Python SDK analogues.

**Prerequisites:**
- A running [Pachyderm cluster](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/get-started/)
- Install the latest package of pachyderm-sdk

**To run:**
From within the pachyderm/python-sdk/examples/breast_cancer_detection directory:
```shell
$ python opencv.py
```
