# JupyterHub Mount Extension

For Data Scientists whose data are stored in Pachyderm, the extension provides a seamless way to:

- Connect your Notebook to a Pachyderm cluster.
- Browse, explore, analyze data stored in Pachyderm directly from your Notebook.
- Run and test out your pipeline code before creating your image. 

**[Pachyderm Mount Extension](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-pachyderm/){target=_blank}** is an add-on/plugin to JupyterHub / JupyterLab that extends the original functionality of your notebook environment, **allowing users of notebooks to mount and unmount Pachyderm data repositories to the file system of their machine or their container**.

!!! Note
     - **Prerequisites**: 

        You already have a Pachyderm cluster running to connect your JupyterLab or JupyterHub. Find Pachyderm installation instructions in the [Deploy/Manage](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/) section of our documentation.

     - **Versions**:

         - Use Pachyderm Mount Extension v?? with Pachyderm 2.1.x and higher. //TBD
         - We recommend JupyterLab >= 3.0.
     
---------------------------- WIP -----------------------------
How do I know what version of Pachyderm is compatible with what version of the extension?
---------------------------------------------------------------


!!! Info
     - The extension mounts data at `/pfs` similar to how a pipeline would see data when running a job.
     - All mounted repositories are **read-only**.
     - The extension requires FUSE. 
     - We apply the `/` globbing pattern to all directories/files in all mounted repo@branch. ?? Does this make sense??

## Install The Mount Extension

The deployment instructions for Pachyderm Mount Extension come in three flavors, depending on where (*Locally or in a VM* ) and what (*JupyterLab or JupyterHub*) you want to deploy it on.

Pick the option that fits your use case:

- Deploy the extension [in a VM](#in-a-container):
    - Deploy in [JupyterLab's container](#deploy-the-extension-in-jupiterLab-container).
    - Deploy on [JupyterHub running in Kubernetes](#deploy-the-extension-on-jupyterHub-running-in-kubernetes).
- Deploy the extension [locally](#on-your-machine) on a JupyterLab installed on your machine.
### 1- In A Container
#### 1.1- Base Image

Depending on your setup, you might choose to use our pre-built image containing the extension or add the extension to your image. We will go through each of those two options:

- You can use Pachyderm's pre-built image [`pachyderm/notebooks user](https://hub.docker.com/r/pachyderm/notebooks-user/tags){target=_blank}:

    !!! Note
        Find the latest available tag of the image `pachyderm/notebooks user in DockerHub to get the latest copy of the extension.

        Our image comes with a pre-installed suite of packages, including:

        - The extension `jupyterlab-pachyderm`.
        - Our Command-Line Tool `pachctl`.
        - FUSE
        - Additionally, it pre-creates the `/pfs` directory files that will be mounted to and grants ownership to the JupyterLab USER.

        The image is based on a GPU-enabled version of [jupyter/base-notebookÂ¶](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-base-notebook).


- Or, add the following to your Jupyterlab Dockerfile, then re-build your image:

    !!! Note
        Replace the following `${PACHCTL_VERSION}` with the version of `pachctl` that matches your cluster's, and update `<version>` with the release number of the extension.

    ```shell
    # This runs the following section as root, if adding to an existing Dockerfile, take care to set the user back to whatever you need.
    USER root

    # This is the directory files will be mounted to, mirroring how pipelines are run.
    RUN mkdir -p /pfs 

    # If you are not using "jovyan" as your notebook user, replace the user here.
    RUN chown $NB_USER /pfs

    # Fuse is a requirement for the mount extension
    RUN apt-get clean && RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install curl fuse 

    # Install Pachctl - Set the version of Pachctl that matches your cluster deployment.
    RUN curl -f -o pachctl.deb -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v${PACHCTL_VERSION}/pachctl_${PACHCTL_VERSION}_amd64.deb
    RUN dpkg -i pachctl.deb

    # This sets the user back to the notebook user account (ie. Jovyan)
    USER $NB_UID

    # Replace the version here with the version of the extension you would like to install from https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-pachyderm/
    RUN pip install jupyterlab-pachyderm==<version>
    ```

    Then, [build, tag, and push your image](../../../how-tos/developer-workflow/working-with-pipelines/#step-2-build-your-docker-image).

#### 1.2-a Deploy The Extension In JupiterLab Container

If you are using our pre-built image, update the tag version of the image `pachyderm/notebooks user in the script below, then run:

```shell
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -e GRANT_SUDO=yes --user root --device /dev/fuse --privileged --entrypoint /opt/conda/bin/jupyter pachyderm/notebooks-user:31d95f869ead4c96aaede284f8d3804020a8d370 lab --allow-root 
```

Click on the link provided in the stdout of your terminal to run JupyterLab in a browser, then jump to the [`Connect Your JupyterLab Extension To Your Pachyderm Cluster`](#connect-your-jupyterlab-extension-to-your-pachyderm-cluster) section.

#### 1.2-b Deploy The Extension On JupyterHub Running In Kubernetes

!!! Info
    Find the complete installation instructions of JupyterHub on Kubernetes in [Jupyterhub for Kubernetes documentation](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#setup-jupyterhub){target=_blank}.


- As a FUSE requirement, add the following to your **Jupyterhub helm chart values.YAML** file to enable root in the `singleuser` containers:

    !!! Note
        Update `singleuser.image.name` and `singleuser.image.tag` to match your user image.

    ```yaml
    singleuser:
        defaultUrl: "/lab"
        cmd:   "start-singleuser.sh"
        image:
            name: pachyderm/notebooks-user
            tag: 624337360beaff8514be329386f3ca554fc7a34d
        uid:   0
        fsGid: 0
        extraEnv:
            "GRANT_SUDO": "yes"
            "NOTEBOOK_ARGS": "--allow-root"
            "JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB": "yes"
            "CHOWN_HOME": "yes"
            "CHOWN_HOME_OPTS": "-R"
    hub:
        extraConfig:
            enableRoot: |
                from kubernetes import client
                def modify_pod_hook(spawner, pod):
                    pod.spec.containers[0].security_context = client.V1SecurityContext(
                        allow_privilege_escalation=True,
                        run_as_user=0,
                        privileged=True,
                        capabilities=client.V1Capabilities(
                            add=['SYS_ADMIN']
                        )
                    )
                    return pod
                c.KubeSpawner.modify_pod_hook = modify_pod_hook
    ```


- Run the following commands to install Jupyterhub:

    ```shell
    helm repo add jupyterhub https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart/
    helm repo update

    helm upgrade --cleanup-on-fail \
    --install jupyter jupyterhub/jupyterhub \
    --values values.yaml
    ```

    !!! Note 
        This may take a while if you are pulling from a large Docker image.


- Find the IP address you will use to access the JupyterHub as described in these [Helm installation instructions](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jupyterhub#setup-jupyterhub) (Step 5 and 6) and open Jupyterlab.

- Click on the link provided in the stdout of your terminal to run JupyterLab in a browser, then jump to the [`Connect Your JupyterLab Extension To Your Pachyderm Cluster`](#connect-your-jupyterlab-extension-to-your-pachyderm-cluster) section.

- Run the following command to refresh the mount server:

    ``` shell
    umount /pfs
    ```
### 2- On Your Machine

- Prerequisites

    - [Install `pachctl`](../../../getting_started/local_installation/#install-pachctl){target=_blank} :
    Make sure that the version of `pachctl` matches the version of your cluster.
 
    - [Have 'pachctl' and your Cluster Communicate](../../../getting_started/local_installation/#have-pachctl-and-your-cluster-communicate){target=_blank} .

    - [Install FUSE](h../../../how-tos/basic-data-operations/export-data-out-pachyderm/mount-repo-to-local-computer/#prerequisites){target=_blank} . Choose the instructions that fit your environment.
    
    - [Test your mount](../../../how-tos/basic-data-operations/export-data-out-pachyderm/mount-repo-to-local-computer/#mounting-repositories-in-read-only-mode){target=_blank} :
     Create a repo containing a file on its master branch, then mount the HEAD on a local directory of your choice. 
    
        !!! Example
            ```shell
            pachctl create repo images
            pachctl put file images@master:liberty.png -f http://imgur.com/46Q8nDz.png
            pachctl mount images --repos images@master
            ```
            The image should be visible in your directory `images` in this example.    
    
    - Create a `/pfs` directory owned by the Notebook USER:

        !!! Example "Example on Debian-based Linux"
            Run the following commands to create the mount directory and install FUSE:

            ```shell
            # Install FUSE
            sudo apt-get update && apt-get -y install curl fuse
            # Create the directory your data will be mounted into and grant your USER access
            sudo mkdir -p /pfs
            sudo chown $USER /pfs
            ```

 
- Install the extension in the python environment where you have [installed Jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/install){target=_blank} 

    ```shell
    pip install jupyterlab
    pip install jupyterlab-pachyderm==<version>
    ```
    !!! Note
        Replace `<version>` with your chosen [version of the extension](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-pachyderm/){target=_blank}.

- Start your JupyterLab
    ```shell
    jupyter-lab
    ```

If you are using the same USER to run JupyterLab, the Mount Extension, and have granted that USER access to `/pfs`, you are all set. You should see your existing repos [ready to be mounted](#use-jupyterlab-mount-extension) in your Notebook and can start experimenting.


## Connect The Extension To Your Pachyderm Cluster

You have a running JupyterLab instance, and you have installed the extension, you now want to connect Your JupyterLab/JupyterHub instance to your cluster.

We made this pretty straightforward. Fill in the `pachcd-address` and port number "<pachd_address>:31400" in the form ... WIP remove instructions below and add instructions to connect to the Login UI once ready.

    !!! Example

            Note: Replace pachd_address value with your own Pachyderm instance.

            ```shell
            echo '{"pachd_address": "<pachd_address>:31400", "source": 2}' | pachctl config set context "nostalgic-camel" --overwrite && pachctl config set active-context "nostalgic-camel"

            pachctl auth login --no-browser

            pachctl auth whoami
            ```


## Use The Extension

Once your JupyterLab is up and connected to your cluster:

- Click on the Pachyderm mount extension in the far left tab bar.

 You should see the repositories ready to be mounted from your Pachyderm instance.
 ![Mount extension in action](../images/mount-extension.gif)

 WIP Insert print screens here and quicl explation of how to select repo@branch??? Or simple add a note to mention that you can select any branch of a repo... 

- If you used our pre-built image `pachyderm/notebooks-user`, use our examples library and start experimenting! 

WIP Examples have been removed from our default image?

!!! Note 
     We have included a selection of data science examples running on Pachyderm, from a market sentiment NLP implementation using a FinBERT model to pipelines training a regression model on the Boston Housing Dataset. In the `/examples` directory, you will also find integration examples with open-source products, such as labeling or model serving applications.
 
From the landing page of JupyterLab, in the `/examples` directory, click on the **Intro to Pachyderm Tutorial**. Follow along to learn the basics of Pachyderm (repos, pipelines, commits, etc...) from your familiar Jupyter notebook. 

 ![Notebooks tutorial](../images/notebooks-tutorial.png)

!!! Note 
     This Tutorial uses Pachyderm's CLI `pachctl`. Feel free to use 'python-pachyderm' instead. ????????
